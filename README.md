# nc100
A small utility for transferring data over a serial line. The basic set of general functions is concentrated in BASE. The rest is the basis for the text UI or Qt UI. The utility is under development and was created as a derivative for the need to transfer firmware to specific devices. It is only available for macOS, eventually it will also be available for Windows.
